## Description

A web app game review site made with Ember 2. Uses Firebase to store data for games and their reviews. Games and reviews have a one-to-many relationship (many reviews for a single game). Games and reviews can be added (with the Admin Access page) and viewed. When adding reviews to games, users may choose to assign a rating to the game by clicking the lightning bolts.
